# Created for recruting purpouses.

ðŸ“« Please read my mail before examining the project.

## Roadmap:

- names-front: It is the frontend of the app, created with React + Vite 
- names-backend [[in another repo]](https://github.com/mcdominik/names-backend): It is the backend of the app, created with Nest.js

## How to run ðŸš€

Project is using mongoDB (atlas), so you need host and password to connect with it, they are in .env file (I attached it to the mail, also with JWT_SECRET)

### frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

app should start on the port 5173

### backend

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
app should start on the port 3000
